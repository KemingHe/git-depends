CHANGES:
April 2025 - Enhanced user experience with the following updates:

1. Added "Try Demo" functionality to load CSE 3241 question bank directly from GitHub:
   - Added a prominent demo button with rocket emoji in a two-column layout
   - Implemented correct data fetching from raw GitHub URL
   - Added loading state and error handling for smoother experience
   - Simplified the user flow for quick access to demo content

2. Added professional footer with:
   - Copyright information crediting Dr. Arnab Nandi and Keming He
   - Direct link to GitHub repository
   - License information

These changes allow users to easily try out the application with sample questions
without having to manually download and upload the question bank CSV file, while
also providing proper attribution and access to the source code.

Original code was created for Arnab Nandi's CSE 3241 course, enhanced with the
